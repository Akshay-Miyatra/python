# Simple Interest Formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100

# Input values
# principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
# rate = float(input("Enter the rate of interest: "))
# time = float(input("Enter the time (in years): "))

# # Calculate simple interest
# simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

# # Display the result
# print("Simple Interest is:", simple_interest)

# salary = int(input("Enter your salary:"))
# print(salary)

# bonous = (10/100) * salary

# print("Bonous salary",bonous)

#3
# km = int(input("Enter km: "))
# print(km)

# miter = km *1000

# print("miter of enter km is ",miter)

# Input distance in kilometers
# km = float(input("Enter distance between two cities in kilometers: "))

# # Conversion formulas
# meters = km * 1000
# centimeters = meters * 100
# feet = meters * 3.28084
# inches = feet * 12
